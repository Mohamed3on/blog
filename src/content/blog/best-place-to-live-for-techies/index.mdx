If you're in tech, whether a founder or IC (individual contributor), and your goal is to maximize your earning potential, expand your professional network, and "manufacture luck",

these are the top places you should consider:

> [!NOTE] Throughout this article, I'll be using the median total comp for a senior software
> engineer as a proxy for the earning potential in a city.
>
> I'll also be using Numbeo's cost of living comparison tool to compare the cost of living in different cities. We will use SF as the base city (cost of living index in SF = 1), and compare the other cities' cost of living to it.
>
> We will calculate the relative living advantage (RLA) of each city compared to SF.

<Latex formula="\text{Salary Ratio} = \frac{\text{Median Salary in City}}{\text{Median Salary in SF}}" />

<Latex formula="\text{Cost Ratio} = \frac{\text{Cost of Living in City}}{\text{Cost of Living in SF}}" />

<Latex formula="RLA = \frac{\text{Salary Ratio}}{\text{Cost Ratio}}" />

Where:

- RLA > 1: Living in this city is more financially advantageous than living in SF.

- RLA < 1: Living in this city is less financially advantageous than living in SF.

# In person

## Tier 1

### 1. San Francisco Bay Area

<Image src={sfSkyline} alt="San Francisco skyline" />

> [!NOTE] The median senior engineer total comp in the bay area is
> [$315,000](https://www.levels.fyi/t/software-engineer/levels/senior/locations/san-francisco-bay-area).

#### A few data points:

Unsurprisingly, the Bay Area remains unmatched in terms of investor, founder, startup, and talent density.

Many of the world’s top tech companies, like Dropbox, Stripe, Coinbase, Scale AI, Airbnb, OpenAI, Anthropic, YC, Meta, Sequoia, Google, Vercel, Apple, Tesla, and most leading VC firms are headquartered here.

> The SF Bay Area has by far the largest share of all tech employees in the U.S., with 49% of all big tech engineers, 35% of AI engineers and 27% of startup engineers. -[SignalFire](https://www.signalfire.com/blog/sf-is-back)

Add to that the nearby talent magnets of Stanford and UC Berkeley, and it's clear why the Bay Area is hard to beat.

While there was an exodus during COVID to places like Texas and Florida, the AI boom has brought the Bay Area back to prominence, with [many people returning](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/07/technology/ai-san-francisco-tech-industry.html).

In short, whether you're looking for a job, starting a company and looking for investment, or just want to expand your network, the bay area is hard to beat as a destination.

If you're building an AI startup or looking to join one, there's no better place to be. The hottest startups and top builders are most likely to be based here.

Beyond the career advantages, San Francisco has great weather year-round, and offers plenty of outdoor activities like hiking, climbing, surfing, and skiing, thanks to being surrounded by nature, beaches, and mountains.

> The average temperature in San Francisco ranges from 7°C to 22°C [year round](https://weatherspark.com/y/557/Average-Weather-in-San-Francisco-California-United-States-Year-Round).

The Bay Area lifestyle is tech-dominant. 9-5 you’re immersed in tech, followed by meetups, and hackathons on the weekend.

> On [Luma](https://lu.ma/discover), there are more meetups in San Francisco than any other city. Luma meetups skew tech-heavy, so this is a good proxy for tech community density.

It's a techie's paradise, and you're likely to overhear tech talk in your local coffee shop.

Out of ~5000 YC companies, **30%** are based in San Francisco. That's _4 times more than the next closest hub, NYC_. You can read more about that in the analysis I made with [Julius](https://julius.ai/chat?id=b7c86d0b-a072-4c87-9c9d-f6b9c8ce52b1).

In SF, you'll earn better than anywhere else, and you'll have the most opportunities to expand your network and advance your career.

As always, however, it's not all rainbows and butterflies:

### Cost of living

- Home ownership is quite unattainable for most people due to high property prices. In SF, [you need a $404,332 household income to afford a median-priced home](https://sfstandard.com/2024/04/27/why-owning-a-home-in-san-francisco-has-never-cost-more/), which is around [$1.4 million](https://theluxuryplaybook.com/san-francisco-housing-market-analysis-forecast-2024-2025/).

- That's why renting in SF is still your best bet, as the price-to-rent ratio is [very high](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/012017/buying-vs-renting-san-francisco-bay-area.asp#toc-renting-in-san-francisco). For reference, the [median rent is $3,500/month](https://theluxuryplaybook.com/san-francisco-housing-market-analysis-forecast-2024-2025/), which is doable with a tech salary.

- Childcare is quite expensive, around 2-3k/month for a for daycare center for an infant (under 2 years old).

### 2. New York

#### RLA

> [!NOTE] The median senior engineer total comp in NYC is
> [$225,000](https://www.levels.fyi/t/software-engineer/levels/senior/locations/new-york-city-area), while it is
> [17.2% more expensive than in SF](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+States&city1=New+York%2C+NY&country2=United+States&city2=San+Francisco%2C+CA). This gives it an **RLA of 0.61**.

#### Why NYC?

What sets NYC apart, however, is that it's a more well-rounded and less tech-dominant city than SF.

In NYC, you're more likely to meet interesting people from all walks of life, as NYC is a cultural hub and a 24h mega-city, where things are always happening and there's a larger variety of people.

Museums, restaurants, stand-up comedy, Broadway, you name it. NYC is unmatched in terms of cultural diversity. If tech is not the only thing you're interested in, NYC might fit you better.

### Public transportation

Unlike in SF, you don't need a car to live comfortably in NYC.

NYC's public transportation is miles better than SF's, the subway system is much more extensive, runs 24/7, is [faster and more efficient](https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1dpx5s2/how_is_public_transportation_compared_to_new_york/), and because the system works 24/7 and you can go home late at night, nightlife becomes more accessible.

### Tech companies in NYC

Here are some of the top companies in NYC:

- Traditional finance: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Bloomberg, etc. They have a lot of tech roles and pay handsomely, but it's a very different culture than tech at startups.
- Ramp
- Etsy
- Stack Overflow

Google and Meta also have significant presences in NYC, especially in AI. Meta AI is headquartered in NYC.

As a rule of thumb, when tech companies reach a certain size, they tend to have a presence in NYC.

The reasons for that are:

- NYC is still a major hub with a large talent pool
- NYC is a major financial and media hub. As companies scale, these connections become more important for more access to capital and media coverage. This is especially relevant for fintech companies targeting Wall Street as clients.

Examples of companies that started in the bay area but have a strong presence in NYC include:

- **FAANG**: Google, Meta ([Meta AI and Instagram are headquartered in NYC](https://www.builtinnyc.com/articles/nyc-facebook-office-tour)), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft
- Salesforce
- Spotify
- **Fintech**: Stripe, Affirm, PayPal, Square

## People you might meet

Some interesting people you might run into in your local NYC coffee shop, from [Tribe Finder](https://tribeFinder.app):

- [Sahil Lavingia](https://twitter.com/shl) (Founder of Gumroad)
- [Patrick OShaughnessy](https://twitter.com/patrick_oshag) (host of Invest Like the Best podcast)
- [John Resig](https://twitter.com/jeresig) (creator of jQuery)
- [Rich Harris](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris) (creator of Svelte)

On Luma, NYC hosts the second most meetups after SF, so it's still a great place to expand your network.

## Tier 2

### 3. London

The median senior engineer total comp in London is
[$153,500](https://www.levels.fyi/t/software-engineer/levels/senior/locations/london-metro-area),
while it is [14.1% cheaper than in SF](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+States&city1=San+Francisco%2C+CA&country2=United+Kingdom&city2=London&amount=6000&displayCurrency=USD),
giving it an **RLA of 0.57**.

After SF & NYC, there's a huge gap in terms of salaries and work opportunities. But the US visa process is insanely hard, restrictive, and stressful, especially if you have a family.

So if you decided to go to Europe instead, London would be your best bet.

It's a mega-city, English speaking, and the visa is much easier to get than the US. There are many Big Tech branches and financial sector companies there that pay relatively well (compared to European salaries).

The flip side of earning less is having more work-life balance and vacation days.

London also has a much richer history than any US city.

The weather is milder than in NYC, but NYC has significantly more sunny days. In NYC, the summers are hot, and the winters are cold & snowy.

I personally prefer the NYC weather to grey mild winters (Berlin has traumatised me).

### 4. Canada

#### Toronto

The median senior engineer total comp in Toronto is
[$123,000](https://www.levels.fyi/t/software-engineer/levels/senior/locations/greater-toronto-area),
while it is [36.5% cheaper than in SF](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+States&city1=San+Francisco%2C+CA&country2=Canada&city2=Toronto&amount=6000&displayCurrency=USD), giving it an **RLA of 0.61**.

#### Vancouver

### RLA

The median senior engineer total comp in Vancouver is
[$141,000](https://www.levels.fyi/t/software-engineer/levels/senior/locations/greater-vancouver?city=1320), while it is
[32.2% cheaper than in SF](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=United+States&city1=San+Francisco%2C+CA&country2=canada&city2=vancouver&amount=6000&displayCurrency=USD),
giving it an **RLA of 0.66**.

### Pros and cons

Canada's geographical proximity to the US, and sharing the same timezone, means that many companies & startups that hire remotely in the US also hire in Canada.

Shopify is the quintessential Canadian tech success story and the [second largest company in Canada by market cap](https://companiesmarketcap.com/canada/largest-companies-in-canada-by-market-cap/).

Canada is also where a bunch of indie hackers are based, examples being:

- [Adam Wathan](https://twitter.com/adamwathan) and [Steve Schoger](https://twitter.com/steveschoger) of Tailwind
- [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos)
- [Josh Comeau](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau)

- [Justin Jackson](https://twitter.com/mijustin) (founder of Transistor.fm)

Many US tech companies also hire in Canada, including:

- Big Tech: Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon, Salesforce
- Startups like Stripe, Twillio and Gusto

Within Canada, Toronto is the largest tech hub. The problem with Toronto, though, is that the cost of living compared to average salaries is very high.

For reference, SF is ~[52% more expensive](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Canada&city1=Toronto&country2=United+States&city2=San+Francisco%2C+CA) than Toronto, but the [median salary](https://www.levels.fyi/t/software-engineer/levels/senior/locations/greater-toronto-area) is 255% higher!

Vancouver is [even more expensive than Toronto](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Canada&city1=Toronto&country2=Canada&city2=Vancouver), though its tech salaries are [slightly higher](https://www.levels.fyi/t/software-engineer/levels/senior/locations/greater-vancouver).

Overall, the pros to Canada are:

- Easy, expedited citizenship process (you can apply for citizenship after 3 years of permanent residency, a relatively short time)

- More work opportunities remotely with startups in the US

- Canadians have their own visa to move to the US, called TN visa. It has no annual cap, unlike H-1B, can be obtained at the border, and can be renewed indefinitely in three-year increments. The downside is that it's a non-immigrant visa, so you can never become a permanent resident or citizen of the US with it, meaning you and your family will always be temporary residents.

So, if you're a software engineer looking to move to the US but can't get a visa easily, a potential path can be:

1. Move to Canada
2. Get a remote US job in Canada
3. Get the Canadian citizenship after 3 years (+ processing time)
4. Get a TN visa
5. Move to the US
6. ???
7. Profit
8. Leave because you're never gonna be a permanent resident

# Remote

In my opinion, if career is a priority for you, prioritizing living in the bay area or NYC should be your top priority. Nowhere else will you find more opportunities for career advancement and $$$ as someone in tech. But if moving there is not an option for you (mainly for visa reasons), then the cost-benefit analysis changes significantly.
