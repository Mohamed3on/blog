I'm a staff engineer in Germany who's been trying to migrate to the US for years. The US still pays 2-3x more than anywhere else, but if you're not American, your visa dictates your entire life.

When I moved to Germany, it was simple: job offer, two months later I'm there. When I left my job, I had 8 months of unemployment benefits, healthcare covered, zero deportation worries.

The US? Every visa option is a nightmare. If you've never had to worry about visas before, the US immigration system will shock you with how restrictive it is. 60 days to find a new job or you're out. Your spouse might not be able to work. One layoff can end everything.

## Your Visa Options (And Why They Matter More Than You Think)

### H1B: The $100K Lottery Ticket Nobody Can Afford

> [!CAUTION]
> **Breaking: September 2025 H1B Overhaul**
>
> The Trump administration just added a [$100,000 fee to H1B petitions](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/trump-overhaul-h-1b-visa.html) (effective September 21, 2025). This applies to [ALL new H1B petitions](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/20/trump-h-1b-immigration-visas) including the 2026 lottery.

The H1B used to be the go-to visa for engineers. With [85,000 spots](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations/h-1b-electronic-registration-process) and the new fee, only the absolute highest-paid positions make economic sense.

> [!NOTE]
> - [$100,000 one-time fee per petition](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/19/trump-h1b-visa-fee-immigration/) + $5-10k legal
> - Lottery odds: [~29% in FY2025](https://www.wsmimmigration.com/immigration-law-insights/2024/uscis-releases-fy-2025-h-1b-registration-statistics/) (before the fee killed it)
> - Companies are already pulling out of H1B sponsorship

Here's the thing: if a company thinks you're worth $100k in visa fees, you probably qualify for O1 anyway. The H1B is dead.

### O1: The 'Extraordinary' Visa That's Now Your Best Bet

The [O1 visa](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/o-1-visa-individuals-with-extraordinary-ability-or-achievement) is for individuals with <GlossaryTerm term="Extraordinary Ability" definition="Sustained national or international acclaim in your field">"extraordinary ability"</GlossaryTerm>. Many ordinary engineers qualify after building the right [portfolio](https://saharmor.medium.com/a-systematic-guide-to-successfully-apply-for-an-o1-visa-ebe126fc39e6). [94.6% approval rate](https://manifestlaw.com/blog/o-1-visa-approval-rate/) as of FY2024.

With H1B basically dead, everyone's scrambling for O1 visas now.

You need to demonstrate "extraordinary ability" through [at least 3 of 8 criteria](https://www.boundless.com/immigration-resources/o-1-visa-explained/): publications (research papers, technical blogs), recognition (awards, conference speaking), leadership (major projects, open-source with wide adoption), high salary ($200k+ total comp), judging others' work, professional memberships, and media coverage.

Takes 2-6 months with <GlossaryTerm term="Premium Processing" definition="Pay extra fee for 15-day decision instead of months">premium processing</GlossaryTerm>. You can work for multiple employers or start your own company. Renewable in 1-3 year increments indefinitely.

Most engineers need 4-6 years experience with 2-3 years focused portfolio building.

> [!WARNING]
> **O1 → Green Card Reality**: Having O1 doesn't guarantee green card approval. You need to meet EB-1A's higher bar (same criteria but stricter review, ~76% approval rate in 2024). Plus: 60 days to find new job if laid off, spouse can't work on O-3, and <GlossaryTerm term="COBRA" definition="Allows you to continue employer health insurance after job loss, but you pay the full premium">COBRA</GlossaryTerm> costs $850-$2k/month.

Best for: Senior engineers with FAANG offers or startup equity who are cool with not knowing where they'll be in 5-10 years.


### L1: The Corporate Fast Lane

The [L1 visa](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/l-1a-intracompany-transferee-executive-or-manager) allows multinational companies to transfer employees to their US offices. With H1B out of reach, L1 is now the most reliable way in for most engineers.

You need 1+ years with the company outside the US, and they need US operations. You'll either get <GlossaryTerm term="L1A" definition="L1 visa for managers and executives">L1A</GlossaryTerm> (managers/executives) or <GlossaryTerm term="L1B" definition="L1 visa for workers with specialized knowledge">L1B</GlossaryTerm> (specialized knowledge).

**L1A** gets you faster green card track (<GlossaryTerm term="EB1C" definition="Fast-track green card category for multinational executives/managers">EB1C</GlossaryTerm>) but requires genuine managerial duties. **L1B** faces more scrutiny from <GlossaryTerm term="USCIS" definition="US Citizenship and Immigration Services - the agency that processes visas">USCIS</GlossaryTerm>. Both start with 3 years, extendable to 5 years (L1B) or 7 years (L1A).

The trade-off is simple: you're stuck with one company (golden handcuffs) and typically get lower comp since you can't leave. But no lottery, no massive fees.

Major companies (Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon) have L1 pipelines through their London/Dublin/Zurich/Toronto offices. Pre-Series B companies typically use contractors/EOR which don't count for L1.

Here's how the L1 pipeline works:

1. Hire you in their London/Toronto/Dublin office
2. Work there for 12 months
3. Transfer you to US on L1
4. Start green card process immediately


## The Make-or-Break Factors

### Spouse Work Authorization (Critical for Families)

| Visa Type | Spouse Can Work? | Timeline | Details |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|---------|
| **L-1 → L-2** | ✅ **Immediately** | Day 1 | Automatic work authorization, no extra paperwork |
| **H-1B → H-4** | ⏳ **After 2-4 years** | After I-140 approval | Must wait for employer's green card process to reach I-140 stage |
| **O-1 → O-3** | ❌ **Never** | N/A | No work authorization available for O-3 at all |
| **TN → TD** | ⏳ **With delays** | 3-6 months | Must apply for separate EAD and wait |


### Your 60-Second Decision Tree (September 2025)

1. **Work for a multinational?** → L1 (spouse can work)
2. **Have exceptional credentials?** → O1 (94% approval but spouse can't work)
3. **Canadian/Mexican?** → TN (fast but not dual-intent)
4. **Under 30?** → Student route or build O1 portfolio
5. **None of the above?** → Remote work from Europe/Latin America


## The Backdoor Routes

### The Student Route

The student visa hack is more important than ever:

- **Timeline**: [3 years to work](https://day1cpt.org/news/understanding-the-h-1b-visa-lottery-odds-and-changes-for-2025-fy) (1 year <GlossaryTerm term="OPT" definition="Optional Practical Training - 12-month work authorization after graduation">OPT</GlossaryTerm> + 2 years <GlossaryTerm term="STEM-OPT" definition="Additional 24-month extension for science/tech/engineering/math degree holders">STEM extension</GlossaryTerm>)
- **The play**: Use those 3 years to build your O1 portfolio - you can't get L1 while in the US
- **Success rate**: Guaranteed work authorization beats playing the lottery


### TN: The NAFTA Cheat Code

<GlossaryTerm term="TN Status" definition="NAFTA/USMCA professional visa for Canadian and Mexican citizens">TN Status</GlossaryTerm> offers:
- No lottery, renewable 3-year permits, start immediately
- **Catch**: Not dual-intent - can't pursue green card while on TN
- Common path: TN → O1 → Green card

### The Canada Detour
- Get Canadian citizenship (3 years) → TN visa to US
- Work for US company in Canada → L1 transfer after 1 year


## US vs Europe: The Real Comparison

**US Pros:** Higher salaries, cutting-edge tech, great healthcare (with job), dynamic career growth, SF/NYC are walkable

**US Cons:** Expensive childcare, limited PTO (2-3 weeks), visa stress, most cities car-dependent

**Europe Pros:** €200 childcare, 5+ weeks vacation, job security, walkable cities, easier immigration

**Europe Cons:** Lower salaries, slower career growth, higher taxes, less cutting-edge work

The tradeoffs are real. In Germany, I never worry about deportation or healthcare. But buying a home on an engineer's salary? Impossible. The career ceiling is much lower, growth is slower. You're choosing between HelloFresh, Delivery Hero, and Zalando in Berlin - that's basically it.

Meanwhile in the US, you have hundreds of companies competing for talent, actual equity upside, and 2-3x the salary. But you're always one layoff away from having to leave the country.

Who should actually move?
- Singles under 30 willing to grind
- L1 transfers (spouse can work)
- Making $400k+
- Must be in-person at cutting-edge AI

### Remote vs. Moving

A [$100k remote job in Portugal can beat a $250-300k visa-dependent job in NYC](https://www.techcities.app/salary-converter?baseCity=porto&targetCity=new-york). That NYC salary becomes ~$110k after childcare and single-income pressure.

Remote works better for mid-level engineers, families needing dual income, or anyone with offers under $300k and dependents.


## Your Action Plan (2025)

### Companies to Target

**AI companies** (mostly SF-based, in-office):
- OpenAI, Anthropic (limited Europe hiring)
- Cursor, Perplexity, CodeRabbit, Replit, Cognition, Cline, Notion (US-only)

**L1-friendly**: Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple (global offices)

**Remote-first sponsors**: Vercel, Linear, ElevenLabs, PostHog, Supabase
Smart strategy: Work remotely first to prove yourself - companies are much more likely to sponsor visas for proven performers than unknown candidates.

### Next Steps

**Outside the US:**
Target L1-friendly companies or build O1 portfolio. Consider Canada/Europe offices for transfers.

**On OPT/STEM-OPT:**
Build O1 portfolio aggressively - you have 3 years max.

**Already on H1B:**
Your visa is gold - start green card process immediately

## Tools to Help You Decide

Before making any big move, run the numbers. I built [Tech Cities Index](https://www.techcities.app/) to help software engineers compare 120+ cities worldwide on metrics that actually matter: purchasing power, safety, salaries, cost of living, weather, and more.

The [salary converter](https://www.techcities.app/salary-converter) shows exactly what salary you'd need in another city to maintain your quality of life. You might be surprised that $100k in Lisbon often beats $300k in San Francisco once you factor in childcare, housing, and visa stress.

## The Bottom Line

The US still has the money and opportunities. With H1B dead, you need O1, L1, or remote work.

Many startups offer $150-250k which isn't amazing if you have kids and your spouse can't work (O1). Yes, you'll get equity, but you're betting everything on that lottery ticket. Use the [salary calculator](https://www.techcities.app/salary-converter) to find your minimum acceptable offer based on your current income.

But remember: even a mediocre initial offer at a good startup can be a stepping stone. Being in the US means access to the network, the competition for talent, and the ability to grow your income fast. Remote workers miss out on this.

Pick based on what matters: immediate money, long-term potential, stability, or life outside work.
