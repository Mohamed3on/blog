The USA still pays software engineers 2-3x more than anywhere else. But if you're not American, your visa dictates your entire life.

## Your Visa Options (And Why They Matter More Than You Think)

### H1B: The $100K Lottery Ticket Nobody Can Afford

> [!CAUTION]
> **Breaking: September 2025 H1B Overhaul**
>
> The Trump administration just added a [$100,000 fee to H1B petitions](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/trump-overhaul-h-1b-visa.html) (effective September 21, 2025). This applies to [ALL new H1B petitions](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/20/trump-h-1b-immigration-visas) including the 2026 lottery.

The H1B used to be the go-to visa for engineers. With [85,000 spots](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations/h-1b-electronic-registration-process) and the new fee, only the absolute highest-paid positions make economic sense.

> [!NOTE]
> - [$100,000 one-time fee per petition](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/09/19/trump-h1b-visa-fee-immigration/)
> - [FY2026 registrations dropped 26.9%](https://goelite.com/blogs/h-1b-visa-lottery-2026-fy-results-out-odds-changes)
> - Lottery odds were [~29% in FY2025](https://www.wsmimmigration.com/immigration-law-insights/2024/uscis-releases-fy-2025-h-1b-registration-statistics/) (before fee)
> - First-year cost: ~$300-400k total (fee + salary + legal)

If you're worth $100k+ in visa fees, you're likely already O1-eligible - and O1 is cheaper ($6-25k) with no lottery. The H1B is essentially dead for new applicants.

### O1: The 'Extraordinary' Visa That's Now Your Best Bet

The [O1 visa](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/o-1-visa-individuals-with-extraordinary-ability-or-achievement) is for individuals with <GlossaryTerm term="Extraordinary Ability" definition="Sustained national or international acclaim in your field">"extraordinary ability"</GlossaryTerm>. Many ordinary engineers qualify after building the right [portfolio](https://saharmor.medium.com/a-systematic-guide-to-successfully-apply-for-an-o1-visa-ebe126fc39e6). [94.6% approval rate](https://manifestlaw.com/blog/o-1-visa-approval-rate/) as of FY2024.

With H1B basically dead, everyone's scrambling for O1 visas now.

You need to demonstrate "extraordinary ability" through [at least 3 of 8 criteria](https://www.boundless.com/immigration-resources/o-1-visa-explained/): publications (research papers, technical blogs), recognition (awards, conference speaking), leadership (major projects, open-source with wide adoption), high salary ($200k+ total comp), judging others' work, professional memberships, and media coverage.

Takes 2-6 months with <GlossaryTerm term="Premium Processing" definition="Pay extra fee for 15-day decision instead of months">premium processing</GlossaryTerm>. You can work for multiple employers or start your own company. Renewable in 1-3 year increments indefinitely.

Most engineers need 4-6 years experience with 2-3 years focused portfolio building.

> [!WARNING]
> O1 doesn't guarantee green card eligibility. India faces 11-12 year waits (EB-2: Jan 2014), China is backlogged, while EU/Rest of World remains current. Timeline: 2-10+ years depending on nationality.

> [!NOTE]
> - $300k in NYC = [$110k elsewhere after childcare](https://www.techcities.app/salary-converter?baseCity=valencia&targetCity=new-york&kids=1)
> - 60 days to find new job if laid off (180-day proposal still pending)
> - <GlossaryTerm term="COBRA" definition="Allows you to continue employer health insurance after job loss, but you pay the full premium">COBRA</GlossaryTerm>: $850-$2k/month for family coverage
> - Startup salaries ≠ job security

Best for: Senior engineers with FAANG offers or startup equity who are cool with not knowing where they'll be in 5-10 years.


### L1: The Corporate Fast Lane That Actually Works Now

The [L1 visa](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/l-1a-intracompany-transferee-executive-or-manager) allows multinational companies to transfer employees to their US offices. With H1B out of reach, L1 is now the most reliable way in for most engineers.

You need 1+ years with the company outside the US, and they need US operations. You'll either get <GlossaryTerm term="L1A" definition="L1 visa for managers and executives">L1A</GlossaryTerm> (managers/executives) or <GlossaryTerm term="L1B" definition="L1 visa for workers with specialized knowledge">L1B</GlossaryTerm> (specialized knowledge).

**L1A** gets you faster green card track (<GlossaryTerm term="EB1C" definition="Fast-track green card category for multinational executives/managers">EB1C</GlossaryTerm>) but requires genuine managerial duties. **L1B** faces more scrutiny from <GlossaryTerm term="USCIS" definition="US Citizenship and Immigration Services - the agency that processes visas">USCIS</GlossaryTerm>. Both start with 3 years, extendable to 5 years (L1B) or 7 years (L1A).

**L1 Trade-offs:**
- **Golden handcuffs**: Stuck with one company (but guaranteed, no lottery)
- **Pay**: Lower comp since you can't leave
- **Unaffected**: No $100k fee like H1B

> [!NOTE]
> The reality is most hot AI startups are SF-based and require in-office work - OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Perplexity, CodeRabbit, Replit, Cognition, Cline, Notion. If you want to work on cutting-edge AI, you likely need to be in the US.
>
> **L1 transfer options**: Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon have offices in London, Dublin, Zurich, Toronto - work there first, then transfer after 12 months.
>
> **Remote-first sponsors**: Some companies like Vercel, Linear, ElevenLabs hire remotely first, then sponsor if you prove yourself. But pre-Series B companies typically use contractors/EOR which don't count for L1.

Companies are now actively creating L1 pipelines:

1. Hire you in their London/Toronto/Dublin office
2. Work there for 12 months
3. Transfer you to US on L1
4. Start green card process immediately


## The Make-or-Break Factors

### Spouse Work Authorization (Critical for Families)

| Visa Type | Spouse Can Work? | Timeline | Details |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|---------|
| **L-1 → L-2** | ✅ **Immediately** | Day 1 | Automatic work authorization, no extra paperwork |
| **H-1B → H-4** | ⏳ **After 2-4 years** | After I-140 approval | Must wait for employer's green card process to reach I-140 stage |
| **O-1 → O-3** | ❌ **Never** | N/A | No work authorization available for O-3 at all |
| **TN → TD** | ⏳ **With delays** | 3-6 months | Must apply for separate EAD and wait |


### Your 60-Second Decision Tree (September 2025)

1. **Work for a multinational?** → L1 (spouse can work)
2. **Have exceptional credentials?** → O1 (94% approval but spouse can't work)
3. **Canadian/Mexican?** → TN (fast but not dual-intent)
4. **Under 30?** → Student route or build O1 portfolio
5. **None of the above?** → Remote work from Europe/Latin America


## The Backdoor Routes

### The Student Route

The student visa hack is more important than ever:

- **Timeline**: [3 years to work](https://day1cpt.org/news/understanding-the-h-1b-visa-lottery-odds-and-changes-for-2025-fy) (1 year <GlossaryTerm term="OPT" definition="Optional Practical Training - 12-month work authorization after graduation">OPT</GlossaryTerm> + 2 years <GlossaryTerm term="STEM-OPT" definition="Additional 24-month extension for science/tech/engineering/math degree holders">STEM extension</GlossaryTerm>)
- **The play**: Use those 3 years to build your O1 portfolio or find an L1 sponsor
- **Success rate**: Guaranteed work authorization beats playing the lottery


### TN: The NAFTA Cheat Code

<GlossaryTerm term="TN Status" definition="NAFTA/USMCA professional visa for Canadian and Mexican citizens">TN Status</GlossaryTerm> offers:
- No lottery, renewable 3-year permits, start immediately
- **Catch**: Not dual-intent - can't pursue green card while on TN
- Common path: TN → O1 → Green card

### The Canada Detour
- Get Canadian citizenship (3 years) → TN visa to US
- Work for US company in Canada → L1 transfer after 1 year


## US vs Europe: The Real Comparison

**US Pros:** Higher salaries, cutting-edge tech, great healthcare (with job), dynamic career growth, SF/NYC are walkable

**US Cons:** $2-4k/month childcare, limited PTO (2-3 weeks typical), visa stress, most cities car-dependent (except SF/NYC/Boston)

**Europe Pros:** €200 childcare, 5+ weeks vacation, job security, walkable cities, easier immigration

**Europe Cons:** Lower salaries, slower career growth, higher taxes, less cutting-edge work

Who should actually move?
- Singles under 30 willing to grind
- L1 transfers (spouse can work)
- Making $400k+ (visa costs become negligible)
- Must be in-person at cutting edge (AI labs, etc.)

### Remote vs. Moving

[A $100k remote job in Portugal beats a $250-300k visa-dependent job in NYC](https://www.techcities.app/salary-converter?baseCity=porto&targetCity=new-york) when you factor in visa stress, childcare costs, and quality of life.

Remote works better for mid-level engineers, families needing dual income, offers under $300k with dependents.


## Your Action Plan (2025)

**Outside the US:**
1. Target companies that hire remotely then sponsor
2. Consider Canada/Europe for L1 pipeline

**On OPT/STEM-OPT:**
1. Find L1 sponsor or build O1 portfolio
2. Network relentlessly

**Already on H1B:**
Your visa is gold - start green card process immediately

## Tools to Help You Decide

Before making any big move, run the numbers. I built [TechCities.app](https://www.techcities.app/) to help software engineers compare 120+ cities worldwide on metrics that actually matter: purchasing power, safety, salaries, cost of living, weather, and more.

The [salary converter](https://www.techcities.app/salary-converter) shows exactly what salary you'd need in another city to maintain your quality of life. You might be surprised that $100k in Lisbon often beats $300k in San Francisco once you factor in childcare, housing, and visa stress.

## The Bottom Line

The US still has the money and opportunities. With H1B dead, you need O1, L1, or remote work. Pick based on what matters: money, stability, or life outside work.
