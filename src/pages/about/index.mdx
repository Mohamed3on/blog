I'm Mohamed, a software engineer from Egypt, currently based in Berlin.

Currently, I'm a product engineer at Edge, beforehand I worked at Affirm, Fast, and HelloFresh.

My interests are mainly around social apps & data, I live my life in pretty data-driven way (every movie I watch, every book I read, every city I visit, every restaurant I eat at is decided based on algorithms I made).

You can read more about my (published) projects [here](/projects). _Hint: they're all about data._
